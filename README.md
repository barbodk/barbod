This is Barbod's first repository, created for the BIMM 143 class to assess project 2 files.
Hi, my name is Barbod. I am a third year neuorbiology major. I have really enjoyed the BIMM 143 class and chose to focus on python in this track.
In this repository, I have inlcuded all the files necessary for Project 2.


In this github repository I have included both a html and ipynb file of my project 2 rought draft, which are an uneditable and python notebook respectively. Furthermore, I have also included a .pdb file of both of my moles, one being 4wsb.pdb and one being 7jtl.pdb. These consist of the molecular structure of the proteins I am analyzing. Lastly, I also included a .fasta file for both of my proteins, 4wsb.fasta and 7jtl.fasta. These contain the sequqneces of the proteins I am analyzing. All of these form what will go into making the final draft of project 2.

My scientific question was: Since they are both enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus, how structurally similar are the  proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the influenza virus, specifically influenza A?

My scientific hypotehsis was: If the SARS-CoV-2 virus displays a protein structure stemming from an overall differing genetic makeup, then there will be no significant similarities between the strucutres of the proteins contained in said virus and the influenza virus.
